<h1>Importing to Mcreator</h1>

<h3>I made some changes. Mcreator will not currently load oblivion</h3>
<p2>I have made a modified version of the 1.18.2-forge generator to stop
failed builds and will probably release it soon if it works properly </p2>


<h3>Mcreator v2022.2</h3>


<p2>download the source code and extract it to the folder of your choice</p2> <br>
<p2>next part is pretty simple double click oblivion.mcreator</p2> <br> <br>

now you should have oblivion in your Mcreator
